# Project Synthesis

It feels like humans have always been fascinated with the idea of creating life by our own means. Using the technology we've cultivated over genertions. Artificial Intelligence as a
concept was born from this same sentiment, you could argue. And the LLMs of today have reached a highly convincing state. This project follows suit in this notion, taking up the torch
to explore yet another facet of this generational wish. I'd personally love for there to be more efforts like this so that *Synthesis* can benefit from their efforts as well, but for the
time being, it appears that I'm the only one pursuing this exact methodology.

Many efforts are centered around trying to design intelligence as a biological isolate. Specifically human intelligence. However, *Synthesis* will be exploring the other direction. That is,
can we create a fully-functioning artificial organism? Not one from or of biological life, but one inspired by the process by whch they were raised. The question that I'm asking in this entire
project is "can you arrive at an intelligent, artificial organism by virtue of evolution?" In other words, if we recreate our own force of evolution, can we give rise to the same emergence that drives
life across the world today? Naturally, I hypothesize that the answer to this questionis "yes."

This project exists in loosely 3 grand stages. The first is one of hands-on development. Creating the tools evolution had at its disposal and the rules by which it played out. This will be the most involved
stage. The second stage is the growth stage, the one where we have a solid base kit fleshed out and begin the actual evolution. There should ideally be little-to-no hands on development here,
and the majority of our efforts will go towards evolving the neurogenesis system within the means we established prior. And naturally, the third and final stage will be integration into the real world.
While I'd ideally carry this out gradually during the 2nd stage, the idea is that by stage 3 we should have a system that operates at least in part in the real world, outside a dedicated test environment.

## Updates

### 07/29/2025 - Neurons
We began by scaffolding the basic neuron system by which the rest of the mechanisms will operate. For now, it's the basic neuron system with expandable types and some basic topology creation stuff.
This is far from finished, but it's a start. We'll further develop the system as the need for complexity arises.
